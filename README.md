# 🧩 ART-ERD: Entity Relationship Diagram for ART Management System


## 🗂️ Project Description

The ART-ERD is designed to help developers and teams clearly understand the data relationships and architecture of a backend system that powers various modules like employee management, client tracking, project handling, and internal workflows.

This project provides:
- 📊 A clear **ER diagram** representing entities and their relationships  
- 🗃️ Database planning and table references  
- 🔐 Field types, constraints, and keys for accurate implementation  
- 📚 Useful for backend development, database normalization, and documentation

## 🧠 Use Case

This ERD is ideal for:
- Project planning & architecture for ART internal systems
- Developer onboarding for database understanding
- Converting into relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Future expansion for application or admin dashboards

## 🔍 ERD Overview

> The diagram illustrates relationships between key entities like:

- **Users / Employees**
- **Departments**
- **Projects**
- **Tasks**
- **Clients**
- **Attendance / Leaves**
- **Roles & Permissions**
